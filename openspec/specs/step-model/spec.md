# Capability: step-model

## Purpose

Defines per-step model and CLI overrides for agent steps.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Per-step model override
A step MAY include a `model` field specifying which model the agent should use. When present, the runner SHALL pass the model to the CLI adapter, overriding the model from the resolved agent profile. When absent, the profile's model is used (which may itself be unset, in which case no model is passed to the CLI). The `model` field is only valid on agent steps, not shell steps.

#### Scenario: Model specified overrides profile
- **WHEN** an agent step has `agent: headless_base` (profile model=opus) and `model: sonnet`
- **THEN** the runner passes sonnet to the CLI adapter, not the profile's model

#### Scenario: No model on step, profile has model
- **WHEN** an agent step does not have a `model` field and the resolved profile has model=opus
- **THEN** the runner passes opus to the CLI adapter

#### Scenario: No model on step, profile has no model
- **WHEN** an agent step does not have a `model` field and the resolved profile has no model set
- **THEN** the runner invokes the CLI adapter without a model override

#### Scenario: Model on shell step
- **WHEN** a shell step has a `model` field
- **THEN** the runner fails with a validation error

### Requirement: Per-step CLI override
A step MAY include a `cli` field specifying which CLI backend to use. When present, it SHALL override the cli from the resolved agent profile. When absent, the profile's cli is used. If both the step and the resolved profile omit `cli`, the runner SHALL fall back to `claude`. The `cli` field is only valid on agent steps, not shell steps.

#### Scenario: CLI specified overrides profile
- **WHEN** an agent step has `agent: headless_base` (profile cli=claude) and `cli: codex`
- **THEN** the runner uses the Codex adapter for that step

#### Scenario: CLI not specified, uses profile
- **WHEN** an agent step has no `cli` field and the resolved profile has cli=claude
- **THEN** the runner uses the Claude adapter

#### Scenario: CLI on shell step
- **WHEN** a shell step has a `cli` field
- **THEN** the runner fails with a validation error

### Requirement: `model` field rejected on UI steps

The `model` field SHALL NOT be valid on `mode: ui` steps. UI steps are not agent steps; they have no model concept. Validation SHALL fail at workflow-load time when a UI step sets `model`.

#### Scenario: UI step with model field
- **WHEN** a step has `mode: ui` and sets `model: opus`
- **THEN** validation fails with an error indicating that `model` is not valid on UI steps

### Requirement: `cli` field rejected on UI steps

The `cli` field SHALL NOT be valid on `mode: ui` steps. UI steps are not agent steps; they have no CLI adapter. Validation SHALL fail at workflow-load time when a UI step sets `cli`.

#### Scenario: UI step with cli field
- **WHEN** a step has `mode: ui` and sets `cli: claude`
- **THEN** validation fails with an error indicating that `cli` is not valid on UI steps

### Requirement: `model` field rejected on script steps

The `model` field SHALL NOT be valid on `script:` steps. Script steps are not agent steps; the model concept does not apply to a bundled script. Validation SHALL fail at workflow-load time when a script step sets `model`.

#### Scenario: Script step with model field
- **WHEN** a step declares `script: detect.sh` and sets `model: opus`
- **THEN** validation fails with an error indicating that `model` is not valid on script steps

### Requirement: `cli` field rejected on script steps

The `cli` field SHALL NOT be valid on `script:` steps. Script steps are not agent steps; they do not invoke a CLI adapter. Validation SHALL fail at workflow-load time when a script step sets `cli`.

#### Scenario: Script step with cli field
- **WHEN** a step declares `script: detect.sh` and sets `cli: codex`
- **THEN** validation fails with an error indicating that `cli` is not valid on script steps
