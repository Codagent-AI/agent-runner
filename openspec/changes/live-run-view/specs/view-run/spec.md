## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Run-view entry points
The CLI SHALL provide two entry points to the run view: a `--inspect <run-id>` flag for direct entry, and an Enter action from the list TUI (covered by the `list-runs` delta). Direct entry SHALL require a full run ID (no prefix matching). When the target run's run-lock is held by another live process, `--inspect` SHALL reject the entry with an error and not launch the TUI.

#### Scenario: --inspect launches run view
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <run-id>` is invoked and the run exists and is not locked by another live process
- **THEN** the run-view TUI launches for that run

#### Scenario: --inspect with unknown run ID
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <run-id>` is invoked and the run does not exist
- **THEN** agent-runner prints an error message naming the missing run ID and exits with a non-zero status

#### Scenario: --inspect requires full run ID
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <prefix>` is invoked with a prefix that is not a complete run ID
- **THEN** agent-runner treats it as "not found" and exits non-zero

#### Scenario: --inspect is mutually exclusive with --list and --resume
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <run-id>` is invoked together with `--list` or `--resume`
- **THEN** agent-runner prints an error indicating the flags are mutually exclusive and exits non-zero

#### Scenario: --inspect rejects a run locked by another process
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <run-id>` is invoked and the target run's run-lock belongs to another live process
- **THEN** agent-runner prints an error to stderr identifying the run as active in another process and exits non-zero; no TUI is launched

#### Scenario: --inspect proceeds past a stale lock
- **WHEN** `agent-runner --inspect <run-id>` is invoked and the target run's run-lock PID is dead
- **THEN** the lock is treated as stale and the run-view TUI launches normally
